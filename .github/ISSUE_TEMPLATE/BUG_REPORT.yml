        Thanks for taking an interest in helping Conda get better! üêç

        Going through bugs and issues takes up a lot of time, so be kind to your fellow developer by taking the time to fill out all the areas to the best of your ability.
         
        There will always be more items than there is time to do them, and so we will need to selectly close bugs that don't have enough info, so we can focus our time on helping people like you who follow the process! By asking questions in a structured way (following this) it will be much easier to help you.
        
        There are also already a lot of open issues, so please take 2 minutes and search through existing ones to see if what you are experiencing already exists

        Thanks for helping Conda be amazing. We are nothing without people like you helping build a better community üçª
